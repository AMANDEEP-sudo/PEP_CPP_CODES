# Linked List Programs

This directory contains various linked list implementations and operations in C++. The codes are organized as follows:

## Structure

- **Linked_List_Programs/**
  - **Singly_Circular_Linked_List/**
    - `circular_traversal.cpp`: Singly circular linked list traversal and insertion operations.
  - ... (other linked list types and operations)

## How to Use

Each folder contains C++ source files for specific linked list types or operations. Compile the `.cpp` files using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++):

```
g++ filename.cpp -o output.exe
./output.exe
```

## Contents
- **Singly_Circular_Linked_List**: Operations for singly circular linked lists (insertion, traversal, etc.)
- More folders will be added for other linked list types and operations.
